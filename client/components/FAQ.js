  // FAQ // Enamel or 'title'

  // What to wear
  // Whatever!  We'll be outside for the cable car ride, and San Francisco is usually chilly even in July.  A jacket or hoodie at minimum is recommended.

  // Where to stay
  // We're working on this but will keep you posted.

  // Is there a gift registry?
  // Yes, and it's right here: <Zola link>

  // How should we be in touch ahead of time?
  // Reach out to Jon or Hermann, or send us a note below.
